This project was an exercise in flow graphs, maximum bipartite matchings and Java data structures. An adjacency list is read from a text file (list.txt) and a flow graph is constructed. The Ford Fulkerson maximum flow algorithm is used and showcased in determining a maximum matching for this graph.
